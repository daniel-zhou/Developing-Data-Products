Performance Prediction of a Car from Design Parameters
==================

This application allows you to predict the performance of a car (in terms of time to complete the quarter mile, and also in fuel economy) based on some basic design parameters one might choose when designing a car. 
Use the inputs on the left panel to design your car, and then view the results above in the main panel. Results are computed immediately upon making a change to a design parameter.

This applicaton uses data from a 1974 Motor Trend survey, and so is not based on cars that use modern technology. 
Also, there are not a lot of realistic restrictions on inputs, so if you're not careful, it is possible to design an unrealistic vechicle. 
Please note that the weight is in thousands of pounds.
